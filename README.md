## This is Octopi, a powerful Pacman/AUR frontend using Qt libs.

The project site is hosted at https://octopiproject.wordpress.com

Currently, 10 Linux distros are compatible with it

 * [Antergos](https://antergos.com/)
 * [ArchBang](http://archbang.org/)
 * [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)
 * [Chakra](https://chakralinux.org/)
 * [CondresOS](https://condresos.codelinsoft.it/)
 * [KaOS](https://kaosx.us/)
 * [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
 * [mooOS](http://mooos.sourceforge.net/)
 * [Netrunner (rolling)](http://www.netrunner.com/netrunner-rolling-release/)
 * [Parabola GNU/Linux-libre](https://www.parabola.nu/)

### What you must install in your system to have Octopi fully functional

You'll need:
 * [Alpm_octopi_utils](https://github.com/aarnt/alpm_octopi_utils/) library
 * A privilege escalation tool to use it. Octopi supports gksu, kdesu and lxqt-sudo for that
 * qtermwidget >= 0.8 in order to build Octopi with embedded terminal support
 
### Simple steps to build Octopi code

Assuming you have Qt5 libs properly installed, go to the directory where the code is located:

```
$ cd OCTOPI_PATH
$ qmake-qt5
$ make
```

You can also use the available PKGBUILD script that helps you build Octopi with all its tools:

```
$ cd OCTOPI_PATH
$ makepkg -f
```

### How to enable AUR support (that "alien" icon at toolbar)

To enable AUR support, you'll need to install [yaourt](https://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en), 
[pacaur](https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur) or [trizen](https://github.com/trizen/trizen) in your system.  
In Chakra, [chaser](https://github.com/ccr-tools/chaser) will be supported out of the box.  
In KaOS, [kcp](https://github.com/bvaudour/kcp) will be supported out of the box.
